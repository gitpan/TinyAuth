NAME
    TinyAuth - Extremely light-weight web-based authentication manager

DESCRIPTION
    TinyAuth is an extremely light-weight authentication management web
    application, initially created to assist in managing a subversion
    repository.

    It is designed to provide the basic functionality of adding and removing
    users, and handling password maintenance with as little code and fuss as
    possible.

    More importantly, it is intended to be extremely easy to install and set
    up, even on shared hosting accounts. The interface is simple enough that
    it can be used on typical limited-functionality browsers such as the
    text-mode lynx browser, and the browsers found in most mobile phones.

    The intent is to allow users and be added, removed and repaired from
    anywhere, even without a computer or "regular" internet connection.
