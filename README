NAME
    TinyAuth - Extremely light-weight web-based authentication manager

STATUS
    TinyAuth is currently currently feature-complete and undergoing
    polishing and testing. Part of this process focuses on naming
    ("TinyAuth" is just a working codename), reduction of dependencies,
    improvements to the installer, and other similar tasks.

    Releases are provided "as is" for the curious, and installation is not
    recommended for production purposes at this time.

DESCRIPTION
    TinyAuth is a light-weight authentication management web application
    with a focus on usability.

    It was initially created to assist in managing a subversion repository
    but also usable for anything where authentication can be run from a
    .htpasswd file.

    It provides the basic functionality needed for adding and removing
    users, and handling password maintenance with as little code and fuss as
    possible, while still applying robust and correct security practices.

    It is intended to be extremely easy to install and set up, even on
    shared hosting accounts. The interface is so simple and pages are so
    small (most under 1k) that it can be used on most limited-functionality
    browsers such as the text-mode browsers, and the strange micro-browsers
    found inside video games and mobile phones.

    The goal is to allow users and be added, removed and fixed from
    anywhere, even without a computer or "regular" internet connection.

  Installing TinyAuth
    TinyAuth uses an installation module called Module::CGI::Install.

    The process involves firstly installing the TinyAuth distribution to
    your (Unix, CGI-capable) system via the normal CPAN client, and then
    running a "CGI Installer" program, which will install a working instance
    of the application to a specific CGI path.

    As well ensuring that the CGI setup is correct, this also means that
    TinyAuth can be installed multiple times on a single host, any each copy
    can be tweaked or modded as much as you like, without impacting any
    other users.

    At the present time, you will need the ability to install modules from
    CPAN (which generally means root access) but once the application itself
    is finished, additional improvements are planned to the installer to
    allow for various alternative installation methods.

    Step 1

    Install TinyAuth with your CPAN client

      adam@svn:~/svn.ali.as$ sudo cpan -i TinyAuth

    Step 2

    Run the CGI installation, following the prompts

      adam@svn:~/svn.ali.as$ cgi_install TinyAuth
      CGI Directory: [default /home/adam/svn.ali.as] cgi-bin
      CGI URI: http://svn.ali.as/cgi-bin
      adam@svn:~/svn.ali.as$

    The installation is currently extremely crude, so once installed, you
    currently need to open the tinyauth.conf file created by the installer
    and edit it by hand (this will be fixed in a forthcoming release).

    The config file is YAML and should look something like this:

      adam@svn:~/svn.ali.as$ cat cgi-bin/tinyauth.conf
      ---
      email_from: adamk@cpan.org
      email_driver: SMTP
      htpasswd: /home/adam/svn.ali.as/cgi-bin/.htpasswd
  
      adam@svn:~/svn.ali.as$

    (For the security concious amoungst you, yes I know that putting the
    .htpasswd there is a bad idea. No, no real service is actually using
    that file)

    The "email_driver" value is linked to Email::Send. Use either "Sendmail"
    to send via local sendmail, or "SMTP" to send via an SMTP server on
    localhost.
